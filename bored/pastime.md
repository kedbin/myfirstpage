# This page holds absolutely no meaning at all, it's just where I keep stuff that I find interesting or stuff the I made while at work.

#### Here is an example

###### A poem : 

I'm typing this while at work,

I see a flock of birds just outside our glass doors, 

they are feeding on scattered bird seeds,

each peck is satisfaction.

-------------------

a kid comes to them running, 

weilding a stick of some sort,

the birds froze 

like the prey animal they are.

-----

the kid starts flailing his stick,

to every direction it goes,

hitting nothing but air, 

the birds fly away.

----

the bird is me,

the kid is me,

nothing makes sense.

----

#### Formatting is a bit weird, hopefully I could work around on that... here's another one.


I'll grow wings and fly to the very top

Feel the breeze underneath, the warmth of the summer sun.

Even if I get shot, sink downwards and crash,

I'll be happy nonetheless.


For, if the cost of experiencing this beauty is death; I'd pick it everytime.
