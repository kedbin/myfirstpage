# Hi, my name is Edrian, and welcome to my ~test~ site!

## I wanted to figure out how to make a website, and what you're seeing now is my humble attempt at one

### I'm also *reaaaalllyyy* bored here at work, where I sit 8 hours infront of a PC browsing the net (best job for my lazy ass).

It's really nice but I think my brain is going to stagnate the longer I stay here... _as it's super easy_

> ~Please don't tell my boss I said that~
