## Documentation
According to my research, it seems that documentation is considered an integral skill in IT. This serves as a log of changes which immensely helps in troubleshooting errors. This also let users and co-developers see recent updates to your program/site/project or see the process of how it was done. Moving forward, I shall document changes that I have done to this little project of mine in this page.
