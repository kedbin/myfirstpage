## Documentation
##### According to my research, it seems that documentation is considered an integral skill in IT. This serves as a log of changes which immensely helps in troubleshooting errors. This also lets users and co-developers see recent updates to your program/site/project or see the process of how it was done. Moving forward, I shall document updates and bugfixes in this section.
